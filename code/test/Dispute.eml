Dear Bank Support,

I am writing to report a disputed transaction on my credit card. On 15th Marc=
h 2025, there was a charge of $350.00 from "XYZ Electronics" which I do not r=
ecognize.

Please investigate this matter. I have attached a copy of my transaction stat=
ement for your reference.

Thank you,
John Doe
