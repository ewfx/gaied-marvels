# README: Setting Up Python Environment for test.py

## Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or later recommended).
- Install `pip` if not already installed.
- Optionally, use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository (If Applicable)
If your script is in a Git repository, clone it using:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

## Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Run the following commands to set up a virtual environment:

### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file. Then install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is missing, manually install required packages:
```bash
pip install fastapi requests python-docx beautifulsoup4 openai sqlite3
```

## Step 4: Run test.py
Execute the script:
```bash
python test.py
```

## Step 5: Deactivate Virtual Environment (Optional)
After running the script, deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\deactivate  # Windows
```

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter missing module errors, ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Use `pip freeze` to verify installed packages:
  ```bash
  pip freeze
  ```
- If the issue persists, reinstall dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Additional Notes
- If working with `.env` files for environment variables, ensure they are correctly set.
- If using FastAPI, run:
  ```bash
  uvicorn test:app --reload
  ```

Now you're ready to use `test.py` in a properly configured environment! ðŸš€
